        <p>This website is built with the middleman ruby framework. Initially, I wanted to avoid learning a new framework and built this site in rails, but it was immediately apparent that rails was overkill for what is essentially a single page app. Consequently, I decided to bite the bullet and take the time to learn a new framework. It was a lot easier than expected. Middleman is based on the padrino framework and has a lot in common with rails, which made learning the new framework easier than expected. I also considered writing the site in jekyll or roots, but since I had already written most of it in rails, middleman was a easy choice.</p>

<p>I plan to document my learning progress and projects as I continue to grow as a developer. Two blog posts that are in the works and will be published soon:  Barter - the team project completed at LEARN and storyShare - a photo journaling app.</p>
