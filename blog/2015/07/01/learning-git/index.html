        <h2 id="settling-on-a-git-workflow">Settling on a Git workflow.</h2>
<p>The first thing you should do when learning git is to learn a git workflow and stick to it until you have you mastered it. Ideally, you should be using your chosen workflow with a group; however, this is not always possible. There are many git workflows and each has its own advantages, and each organization will have their own preference. A quick google search will provide you with a few options. Start with a simple workflow and learn others as you progress.</p>

<p>Git workflows are best learned while working with a group of developers because will force you to use good git habits and you will experience all facets of using git. Good git habits include using separate branches for each feature, committing often, issue tracking, and pushing changes to the remote repository on a regular basis.</p>

<h4 id="use-branches">Use Branches</h4>
<p>It is important when you are working on a project to use separate branches for each feature that you are implementing. This assists in reducing and simplifying merge conflicts and limits the scope of changes to the project.</p>

<h4 id="commit-often">Commit Often</h4>
<p>Commit often to keep your codebase up to date with the remote codebase. Commits create data points that represent changes to your code. It can be tempting to dely a commit until you have cleaned up the code or fear for showing some act of stupidity, but this should always be avoided. Committing often leads directly to the next good git habit: useful commit messages.</p>

<h4 id="make-useful-commit-messages">Make Useful Commit Messages</h4>
<p>Commit messages are only helpful when they are clear, insightful and descriptive. It allows people to quickly understand changes without having to read the code. It is also useful when you return to your code weeks later to review.</p>
