        <p>This is a general overview of my problem solving process. Coding is really about how you solve problems and translate them into code. Programmers use algorithms as a Working on algorithms has been instrumental to my growth as a developer.</p>

<h4 id="understand-the-problem">Understand the problem</h4>
<p>Before working on a problem, it is important to understand what you are solving. Often, solving a problem that may seem overwhelming is easiest by breaking that problem into smaller, easily solved problems.<br />
- Break the problem into small pieces and know how they work together
- Outline the problem with psuedo code</p>

<h4 id="ask-the-right-questions">Ask the Right Questions</h4>
<p>Recognize underlying assumptions</p>

<h4 id="get-unstuck">Get Unstuck</h4>
<p>In no particular order:
- Work through similar examples.
- Break the problem down into simple steps.
- If using a gem or library, read the codebase for a better understanding
- Ask Google/StackOverflow/mentor
- Check log for errors (obvious, but easily overlooked)
- Talk to the rubber duck (especially helpful if you have a really smart rubber duck)</p>

        <h2 id="settling-on-a-git-workflow">Settling on a Git workflow.</h2>
<p>The first thing you should do when learning git is to learn a git workflow and stick to it until you have you mastered it. Ideally, you should be using your chosen workflow with a group; however, this is not always possible. There are many git workflows and each has its own advantages, and each organization will have their own preference. A quick google search will provide you with a few options. Start with a simple workflow and learn others as you progress.</p>

<p>Git workflows are best learned while working with a group of developers because will force you to use good git habits and you will experience all facets of using git. Good git habits include using separate branches for each feature, committing often, issue tracking, and pushing changes to the remote repository on a regular basis.</p>

<h4 id="use-branches">Use Branches</h4>
<p>It is important when you are working on a project to use separate branches for each feature that you are implementing. This assists in reducing and simplifying merge conflicts and limits the scope of changes to the project.</p>

<h4 id="commit-often">Commit Often</h4>
<p>Commit often to keep your codebase up to date with the remote codebase. Commits create data points that represent changes to your code. It can be tempting to dely a commit until you have cleaned up the code or fear for showing some act of stupidity, but this should always be avoided. Committing often leads directly to the next good git habit: useful commit messages.</p>

<h4 id="make-useful-commit-messages">Make Useful Commit Messages</h4>
<p>Commit messages are only helpful when they are clear, insightful and descriptive. It allows people to quickly understand changes without having to read the code. It is also useful when you return to your code weeks later to review.</p>

      </h2>
      <div class="flow-text">
        <p>This website is built with the middleman ruby framework. Initially, I wanted to avoid learning a new framework and built this site in rails, but it was immediately apparent that rails was overkill for what is essentially a single page app. Consequently, I decided to bite the bullet and take the time to learn a new framework. It was a lot easier than expected. Middleman is based on the padrino framework and has a lot in common with rails, which made learning the new framework easier than expected. I also considered writing the site in jekyll or roots, but since I had already written most of it in rails, middleman was a easy choice.</p>

<p>I plan to document my learning progress and projects as I continue to grow as a developer. Two blog posts that are in the works and will be published soon:  Barter - the team project completed at LEARN and storyShare - a photo journaling app.</p>
